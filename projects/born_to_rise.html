                    This is the final project of my HND in Videogames Programming
                    at ESAT. It is a 2.5D platformer that is being developed by 
                    a multidisciplinary team of 7 programmers, 6 artists and 3
                    game designers. You can follow the game progress at
                    <a href="https://twitter.com/BornToRiseGame">@BornToRiseGame</a>.
                    <br><br>
                    This project tries to be a very close approximation of how 
                    a video games studio works. We have tight schedules with
                    deadlines and milestones such as prototype and first playable.
                    We work under an adaptation of the scrum methodology where we 
                    have weekly sprints. Each sprint begins and ends with a meeting
                    where we assess the progress of each department and how well
                    are we reaching our objectives.
                    <br><br>
                    The most important aspect of this project is the communication
                    both between peers of your own team and between teams. Constant
                    communication with our fellow designers and artist is key
                    to have a smooth development and to better iterate on the
                    game.

                  <h4>Combat system and player mechanics.</h4>
                  <p>
                    I was one of the people in charge of creating the player combat
                    actions, which were: melee attack that knock enemies back, main
                    range attack that fires a spray of bullets and secondary range
                    attack that fires a powerfull wave that deals heavy damage and
                    passes through enemies.
                    <!--
                    <br><br>
                    Both the melee and range attacks are their own Components 
                    (MeleeComponent and ShooterComponent). The ShooterComponent
                    is general to all actors, player and enemies. It gives the
                    Actor the ability to shoot one kind of bullet with a custom
                    rate of fire.
                    <br><br>
                    The player uses the PlayerShooterComponent, that inherits from
                    the ShooterComponent, to expand the functionality of the parent
                    component to add the secondary attack as well as ammo capacity
                    that limits how many bullets the player can fire. The component
                    reloads bullets at a given rate and, if deplenished, enters
                    an overload state, stopping the reload for some seconds.
                    reload of bullets-
                    -->
                    <br><br>
                    I was also in charge of the HealthComponent that the player and
                    the enemies shared. This ActorComponent tracks the health of
                    the Actor and handles the Actor death and reviving through
                    delegates. Along with the HealthComponent, I implemented an
                    interface to be used for all the Actors that could be damaged,
                    called IDamageable, so that taking damage could be abstracted
                    from the actor and handled directly with the HealthComponent.
                    <br><br>
                    Another feature involved with the combat system was the knockback
                    and hit stop of the player and enemies. Whenever the player is hit
                    or when the player attacks an enemy with the melee attack, the damaged
                    Actor is knocked back and both actors are stopped for some frames
                    to give more impact to the action.

                  <h4>Dash ability of the player.</h4>
                  <p>
                    The dash is an Actor Component that provides the Actor with
                    a dash. It can be added to any actor that needs a dash ability.
                    The dash launches the actor in a given direction, removing the
                    gravity force for the duration of the dash. It also grants 
                    invulnerability for a period of time. So it can be used to dash
                    enemies, bullets or hazards. It also has a cooldown to avoid
                    spamming the dash. This cooldown is reseted after a period of
                    time or if the Actor hits a wall, platform or the ground.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    This platforms break on contact if you step over them. When 
                    a hit is registered in the platform, a timer is set to display
                    the <i>OpenPlatform</i> animation. In this animation, an
                    AnimNotify event is dispatched to remove the collision of the
                    platform and to begin another timer for the cooldown before
                    it restores its natural state. Then the <i>ClosePlatform</i>
                    animation is played, with another AnimNotify that restores the
                    platform collisions, returning to its initial state.

                    I created a blueprint that constructed a spline mesh with
                    static meshes for the designers and artists to use. You can 
                    specify if the spline has collision or not and specify which
                    type of meshes to use for the initial and final sections as well
                    as the mid sections. You can add more than one type for each
                    section and the spline mesh will select a random static mesh
                    from the sample given.
